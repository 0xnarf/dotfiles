# Introduction

This repository is a little guide to recreate my workspace, with the previous NvChad config for nvim.
This config for nvim has:

- Custom highlighting for lua and python. 
- Installed LSP servers for php, lua and bash
- More plugins than NvChad's default plugins like:    
  - **Nvim-ts-rainbow** *A Treesitter module which helps to identify brackets with colors in your workspace*
  - **Treesitter playground** *Another module which helps you to identify highlightings, its usefull to make own colorschemes*
  - **KNAP** *Plugin which allows you to make live debugging .texfiles and .md files*
  - **Startup nvim** *A plugin which gives a initial nvim's dashboard*
